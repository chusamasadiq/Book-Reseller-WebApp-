            <h3 class="text-justify pt-5" >Book Reseller’S MISSION IS TO MAKE IT EASY TO DO BUSINESS ANYWHERE </h3>
            <p class="text-justify">We enable businesses to transform the way they market, sell and operate and improve their efficiencies. 
          	We provide the technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help merchants, brands, retailers and other
	          businesses to leverage the power of new technology to engage with their users and customers and operate in a
	          more efficient way.</p>
    
          <p class="text-justify">We use customer data responsibly to improve your experiences with Book Reseller, from personalizing shopping in Book Reseller’s online store to enabling Alexa to recognize different
	          accents and dialects. We can show you items inspired by your previous Amazon purchases, whether that’s a new fashion brand or a personalized playlist on Amazon Music. 
	          Across all of Book Reseller’s products and services, our principled approach to privacy begins with three key priorities<b>: transparency, customer control, and security.</b>
          </p>    

          <h2 class="text-justify">Transparency</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">We always strive to be clear about how Book Reseller is collecting, using, or sharing your personal data. That’s why we not only build privacy directly into our products and 
	services, but we also make it easy and intuitive for customers to learn more about how Book Reseller collects, uses, and shares their data. Book Reseller allows the 
	customers to view their browsing and purchase history from “Your Account” and manage which items could be used for product recommendations. You can also easily view all your shipping addresses, digital content purchases, and device information, and manage your payment methods directly from Your Account.

Our Privacy Notice describes in simple language how Book Reseller and its affiliates collect, use, and share customers’ personal data through Book Reseller websites, devices,
	 products, and services, as well as through online and physical stores. You can also request a copy of the data that Book Reseller collects across our various products 
	and services by submitting a request. (Some Book Reseller subsidiaries, like Ring, have their own data request pages.)

<h2 class="text-justify">Customer Control</h2>
<p class="text-justify">  Transparency

	services, but we also make it easy and intuitive for customers to learn more about how Book Reseller collects, uses, and shares their data. Book Reseller allows the

</p class="text-justify">
<h2 class="text-justify">Security</h2>
<p class="text-justify">  And finally, keeping your data private requires a focus on data security. Book Reseller designs all of our products, services, and systems with privacy and security in mind,
	 and we employ thousands of professionals whose sole mission is to ensure the integrity and security of customer data. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural
	 safeguards in connection with the collection, sharing, and storage of customer data, and our devices offer security features that protect against unauthorized access 
	and loss of data. We also use proven encryption protocols and software to protect the security of your personal data during transmission.

For example, 
	Ring offers the choice for end-to-end encryption of customer videos on eligible devices. This advanced encryption option allows only a user’s enrolled 
	mobile device to decrypt videos. Book Reseller devices also regularly receive security updates with the latest protections against possible threats and vulnerabilities. In 
	many cases, customers don’t have to do anything to update their devices—it happens automatically when the devices are connected. These security measures help to 
	ensure that your devices and your data stay protected against bad actors.

Book Reseller products and services also benefit from the underlying privacy and security capabilities of Book Reseller Web Services , one of the most secure cloud computing 
	environments available today. Our core infrastructure is designed to satisfy the security requirements for military, global banks, and other high-sensitivity 
	organizations, and it includes sophisticated technical and physical measures to prevent unauthorized access. Book Reseller also has a world-class team of security experts 
	monitoring our infrastructure 24/7 to protect our customers. Learn more about AWS and privacy.

In addition to our own internal security processes and procedures, we work to educate customers on how they can help keep their account information private with 
	simple steps, such as creating strong, unique passwords and using multi-factor authentication.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">Caring about our customers means caring about the privacy of their data. We appreciate that customers who use our products and services every day trust that we will 
	collect, use, and store their personal data carefully and responsibly. We will continue to build privacy and security features into all of our products and services, 
	and we look forward to sharing more about the people, processes, and technologies that enable us to earn and maintain the trust of customers around the world.</p>
