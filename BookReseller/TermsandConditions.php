</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-justify">Acting Fairly</h3>
<p class="text-justify">You must act fairly and lawfully and may not misuse any service provided by Shoppyzone. Examples of unfair activities include:</p>

<ul class="text-justify">
<li>Providing misleading or inappropriate information to Shoppyzone or our customers, such as by creating multiple detail pages for the same product or posting offensive product images</li>
<li>Manipulating sales rank (such as by accepting fake orders or orders that you have paid for, or refunded externally or orders that you discounted externally) or making claims about sales rank in product titles or descriptions</li>
<li>Attempting to increase the price of a product after an order is confirmed</li>
<li>Artificially inflating web traffic (using bots or paying for clicks, for example)</li>
<li>Attempting to influence search results by inflating search ranking through keyword manipulation or incentivizing customers’ searches to appear as organic behavior</li>
<li>Attempting to damage another Seller, their listings or ratings</li>
<li>Allowing other people to act on your behalf in a way that violates Shoppyzone’s policies or your agreement with Shoppyzone </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-justify">Ratings, Feedback, and Reviews</h3>
<p class="text-justify">You may not attempt to influence or inflate customers’ ratings, feedback, and reviews. You may request feedback and reviews from your own customers in a neutral manner, but may not:</p>

<ul class="text-justify">
<li>Pay for or offer an incentive (such as coupons or free products) in exchange for providing or removing feedback or reviews</li>
<li>Ask customers to write only positive reviews or ask them to remove or change a review</li>
<li>Solicit reviews only from customers who had a positive experience</li>
<li>Review your own products or a competitors’ products</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-justify">Customer Information</h3>
<p class="text-justify">If you receive customer information such as addresses or phone numbers to fulfill orders, you may use that information only to fulfill orders and must delete it after the order has been processed. You may not use customer information to contact customers (except through Buyer-Seller Messaging) or share it with any third-party.</p>

<h3 class="text-justify">Circumventing the Sales Process</h3>
<p class="text-justify">You may not attempt to circumvent the Amazon sales process or divert Amazon customers to another website. This means that you may not provide links or messages that prompt users to visit any external website or complete a transaction elsewhere.</p>

<h3 class="text-justify">Communications</h3>
<p class="text-justify">You may not send unsolicited or inappropriate messages. All communications to customers must be sent through Buyer-Seller Messaging and be necessary for fulfilling the order or providing customer services. Marketing communications are prohibited.</p>

<h3 class="text-justify">Multiple Selling Accounts on Shoppyzone</h3>
<p class="text-justify">You may only maintain one Seller Central account for each region in which you sell unless you have a legitimate business need to open a second account and all of your accounts are in good standing. If any of your accounts are not in good standing, we may deactivate all of your selling accounts until all accounts are in good standing.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Examples of a legitimate business justification include:<p>

<ul class="text-justify">
<li>You own multiple brands and maintain separate businesses for each</li>
<li>You manufacture products for two distinct and separate companies</li>
<li>You are recruited for an Shoppyzone program that requires separate accounts</li>
</ul>
